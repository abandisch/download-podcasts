# A Script to Download Podcasts


# Why

- As podcast enthusiast, I would like the ability to scrape an entire podcast's library of episodes so I can safely archive it in my own personal files.
- As a friend to someone who is a luddite, I would like the ability to snail mail them a usb drive of podcast episodes to listen to.

# How

- Podcast Parser to parse the rss feed of the podcast
- From the feed, we get the metadata of the podcast
- Use the metadata to generate the title

# Maybe Future

- create own rss parser
- download to something other to local machine
- further validation of the feed and data within feed
- actually be an installable cli
- able to periodically check for new podcast episode
- able to take in multiple podcast feeds
- pytest testing setup
